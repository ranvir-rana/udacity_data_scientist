## Project: Analysis of Airbnb Data from Boston and Seattle

### Installations

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.

### Project Motivation

Writing a data science blog post using CRISP-DM is required as part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree project for Term 2. 
I was interested in researching and analyzing business-related inquiries concerningBoston and Seattle Airbnb rentals. This fascination is a result of my regular use of AirBnB and my general curiosity about how pricing are changing and what factors may be at play.

This can can be modified to analyze other data sets other than Boston and Seattle data.

for more information refer to the medium blogpost for this project: https://medium.com/@ranvir_rana/in-depth-analysis-of-airbnb-data-from-boston-and-seattle-4489180ff612.

### summary of the project

In this notebook I wanted to analyze the Boston and Seattle airbnb listings. I used descriptive statistics and  Gradient Boosting Regressor to answer the following questions:


Q.1 When is the best time to visit Boston and Seattle?

Q.2 What factors are most important for determining the cost of an Airbnb rental?

Q.3 What are the most desired facilities when consumers search for rental properties?


### File Descriptions

- Data: folder containing the airbnb data required for the analysis(this folder and associated folders needed to be created as per Data instructions).

- In_depth_Analysis_of_Airbnb_Data_from_Boston_and_Seattle.ipnyb:a notebook containing the analysis for the data.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `Project 1 - Writing a Data Scientist Blog Post/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook In_depth_Analysis_of_Airbnb_Data_from_Boston_and_Seattle.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter In_depth_Analysis_of_Airbnb_Data_from_Boston_and_Seattle.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Data

The data used in this project was acquired from kaggle for Boston and Seattle city using the following [link1](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data) & [link1](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston). 

Create a data directory containing the following required downloaded files from the above repo:
